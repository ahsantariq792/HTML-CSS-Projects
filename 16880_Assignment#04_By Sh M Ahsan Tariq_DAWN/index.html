    <h1>Vaccination Begins</h1>

            <b>
                THE next phase in Pakistan’s fightback against the novel coronavirus has begun with appropriate
                fanfare. On Tuesday at the PM Office, in the presence of Prime Minister Imran Khan, anaesthetist
                and critical care specialist Prof Rana Imran Sikander became the first person in the country to
                be vaccinated against the disease.
            </b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The first batch of Covid-19 vaccines, totalling half a million doses manufactured by Sinopharm, had
            arrived in Islamabad from Beijing on Monday, and the federal government dispatched the provinces
            their share from it the next day. Inoculation drives on a provincial level began yesterday. The
            National Command and Operation Centre deserves plaudits for the smooth start to the mammoth
            countrywide campaign. Judging by the detailed plan it has drawn up, considerable effort is being
            expended to ensure that vaccine procurement keeps up with the pace of inoculation, and a report in
            this paper yesterday quoted SAPM on Health Dr Faisal Sultan as saying he does not believe the supply
            side will pose a problem.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">
            “We are more concerned about the demand side,” he said. The fear is that of the 70m of the adult
            population who should be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, as per health experts’ view, a
            considerable number — up to 30m — may refuse it or opt out for one reason or another.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">
            That is among several concerns in a situation where, at least to some extent, the authorities are
            flying blind. The novel coronavirus has been around for a little over a year. It is only recently
            that health professionals have got a handle on managing severe cases of Covid-19 to a certain
            extent, while the long-term and sometimes devastating implications of the disease are still being
            observed and understood.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The immune system’s response to the vaccines, despite extensive human trials leading up to the
            approval stage, remains the subject of some debate. Consider that health authorities in France and
            Sweden have cleared AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine but advised against administering it to people
            over 65 years; that is at variance with the EU’s decision to approve the vaccine for adults
            of all ages. Meanwhile, a major UK study has confirmed that most people who have been infected with
            the coronavirus have antibodies in their blood for at least six months. Earlier, the consensus on
            viral immune response had considered three months as a minimum period during which one was highly
            unlikely to be reinfected.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="paragraph">
            One hopes that the government’s timeline regarding the procurement of the remaining batches of the
            vaccines is a realistic one. In the meantime it must prepare the Pakistani public about possible
            side effects of inoculation so that misinformation does not discourage people from registering.
            Further, regular updates with disaggregated data about those being inoculated will go a long way
            towards countering inevitable rumours about ‘elite’ individuals jumping the queue. Instilling trust
            in the transparency of the process is critical.
        </p>
